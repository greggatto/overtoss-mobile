This shows the pointers that define the initial angle and speed

Two objects per pointer (Background image and the pointer) [Total of 4 objects]
                    OR
Two objects (Background and pointers), which change behavior based on what pointer is active

====== Angle Pointer ======

90 degrees of a circle

Pointer goes from 0 to 90 at a speed based on the Overlord's 'precision stat'

    After tapping it, the pointer stops and the Power Pointer is shown
    
====== Power Pointer ======

Horizontal bar

Pointer goes horizontally between the left and right of the bar
at a speed based on the Overlord's 'precision stat'

     After tapping it, the pointer stops and after a small delay, both pointers vanishes
     and the minion is launched.
